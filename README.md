# Credit_Risk_Analysis

The written analysis has the following:

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
  The purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt)

The purpose of this analysis was to use various machine learning models performance to determine the best model to predict credit risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.
evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results:
There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)


## Summary:
There is a summary of the results (2 pt)

There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
